        <h2>statement</h2>
        <p>This is an open call for engagement that reaches out to you. The writing of this letter grew out of many conversations with artists from various disciplines. In the wake of the global spreading of #metoo, we gathered information in our communities and concluded that even though we are not surprised, the reoccurring patterns of systematic sexism is an outrage.</p>
        <p>Signing this call is a way of showing your commitment in a worldwide movement against sexual harassment, sexual violence and structural sexism. In this call the following proposals focus especially on the Belgian arts field.</p>

        <h3>I engage as an artist</h3>
        <p>When we says ‘artists’, we mean: dancers, theatre makers, choreographers, actors, academics, writers, musicians, film directors, visual artists, illustrators, composers, designers, poets, circus artists or anything we want to name ourselves.</p>
        <p>As artists we acknowledge the issues of sexism and sexual harassment in our field. We don’t need to have experienced harassment to know it is out there. <a href="http://www.not-surprised.org/" target="_blank">Abuse of power comes as no surprise</a>. With the knowledge that abuse is often linked with the precarious working conditions of artists: we demand radical change.</p>
        <p>We stand in support with our peers who have felt discriminated, harassed and abused. We will check in with our surrounding art communities. We will listen and act where needed. We will apologize where we failed to show solidarity. We will collectively work against any form of intimidation. We’ll remain open in this complex conversation, but believe that certain consequences are simply a matter of justice. As an art community we have zero tolerance towards abuse of power. We will no longer be bystanders, we’ll engage.</p>
        <p>We know our rights and we will defend them. Not only for ourselves, but especially for the most marginalized of our peers. Gender inequality is but a facet of the intertwined systems of oppression keeping toxic power relations in place. Our fight against sexism is also a fight against racism, xenophobia, homophobia, ableism and any other form of discrimination. Or as Angela Davis famously put it: “We must learn to lift as we climb.”</p>

        <h3>We engage as an institution</h3>
        <p>When we say ‘institution’, we mean: any person working in a structure that funds, supports and therefore exists thanks to the material and immaterial labor of artists.</p>
        <p>As an institution we might not always have been aware of the widespread issues of sexual harassment and power abuse. For this lack of care, we apologize. As an institution we will now actively take our responsibility in tackling any form of power abuse.</p>
        <p>We stand in support with the demands of the art communities we represent. We will listen to their needs and make structural changes according to them. We will engage in a transparent and constructive conversation. This means that we will analyze diversity in our arts program and evaluate our internal structures accordingly. We will improve the current procedures dealing with complaints of harassment and discrimination. We will make sure that people know that when they speak up, they will be heard.</p>
        <p>We will no longer support artists who abuse their power. We will stop programming sexist work. In return we will support and cherish the work of artists who show new forms of radical imagination.</p>

        <h3>We engage as an art education</h3>
        <p>When we say ‘art education’, we mean: any person involved with the education of artists.</p>
        <p>We will not hide away from this uncomfortable discussion. We will open the discussion with our students. We will listen and make changes accordingly. Any complaint concerning intimidation, harassment, or manipulation will be taken seriously and will have repercussions.
        Favoritism, humiliation and bullying is not a teaching technique. We will no longer work with teachers, directors or mentors who abuse their power.</p>
        <p>We will no longer see art education simply as a ‘reflection’ of the professional field, but as a crucial place of change that has the potential to shape the future. Also, education should encourage and advocate equality, solidarity and diversity at every level. We will offer all students the education they need and deserve.</p>

        <h3>We engage as spectators</h3>
        <p>When we say ‘spectator’, we mean any person who cares for art.</p>
        <p>We will no longer applaud sexist, racist, xenophobic or discriminating art. We’ve had enough of art that celebrates inequality. We demand that institutions support work that triggers new fields of imagination. When we see art that perpetuates harmful representation, we’ll speak up and open a conversation (letter).</p>

        <h3>I engage because I crossed the line</h3>
        <p>When we say ‘crossing the line’, we acknowledge that according to the definition of sexual harassment, we might have willingly or unwillingly pushed the boundaries of colleagues. By recognizing these actions we actively engage in this conversation. We’ll face consequences when abuse of power was severe and frequent.</p>

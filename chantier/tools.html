            <h3>1. What could be done by your own means?</h3>
            <p>Say « No » to the person whose behaviour towards you is displaced. It is important to set your own boundaries, because they are different for everyone. If you feel in a position where you can talk, make sure this person knows that he/she/they went too far. Make clear how you would like to see the incident solved.</p>
            <p>Ask for support and help from a colleague or a person you trust.</p>

            <p>Examine what are the actions to undertake within the organization.

        <h3>What to undertake as an employer, organization, institution to prevent and attack harassment in the professional context :</h3>
        <p></p>
    </div>
    <div class="tool tool-content">
        <p>1. Affirm that your organization gives importance to the leadership ethics, to the appropriate relations with each others and that zero tolerance is practiced in regard to harassment… For example, you could make your position explicit in the welcoming brochure, conduct code, chart, …</p>
        <p>2. Discuss concretely during performance review meetings the conduct to be adopted, particularly with those in head positions.</p>
        <p>3. Make aware and inform your workers of the subject, in a way that would not make it  a taboo, create the culture of openness and transparency in communication. This way you will minimize the risk of victims to remain silent. Make sure, if necessary, to propose formations, as on individual as on the level of the entire organization.</p>
        <p>4. Inform yourself of the legal frame :</p>
        <p>– You can form one or several confidential persons.<br>
            – Make sure that it is clear for everyone who is the person to consult on prevention of psychosocial aspects (possible starting from 5O workers), or inform which service you are working with.<br>
            – Take those information from work regulations and make sure they are communicated clearly and are visible somewhere (intranet, valves,…).<br>
            – Arrange so that temporary workers would also know where to address.<br>
            – Mention eventually possible sanctions (warnings, penalties, suspensions of the working contract,…).</p>
        <p>5. Provide (possibly send to) psychological support, if despite all, harassment took place.</p>
